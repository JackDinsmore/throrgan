# Throrgan

## Description
Throrgan is an electronic music compiler started by Jack Dinsmore in June of 2021. It reads "throrgan-format" music text files which outline the notes to be played and compiles them into .wav files.

Multiple "instruments" are available to convert between notes and sounds. Several are in-built, and more can be added

Future projects will introduce a processor to create "throrgan-format" music files by adding notes to a musical staff, and potentially one to create and edit instruments.
